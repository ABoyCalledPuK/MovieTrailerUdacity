# MovieTrailerUdacity
First Project for Udacity

This project will allow a user to input movie ID's from www.themoviedb.org and than show said movies in your browser. 

Firstly go to www.themoviedb.org and search for film. When a film has been chosen you will find the movie ID in the url in front of the movie title. 

For example the title of films and there related ID's:

271110 - Captain America Civil War, 
258489 - The Legend Of Tarzan,
68735 - Warcraft, 
76341 - Mad Max: Fury Road,

When you wish to run the program input $ python entertainment_center.py

You will see a message “Film ID's can be found "www.themoviedb.org", To exit type any string” and than asked to enter a film ID. 

To demo the program you may use the ID’s stated above. 

Press enter and the page should open automatically in your browser. If this is not the case there will be a “fresh_tomatoes.html” in the main directory that can be used to open the page. 

Unfortunately the API being used does not give data on trailers so these will default to “The Matrix” official trailer from youtube.
